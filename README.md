## Overview
When provided a location the app will display a map of the area according to latitude and longitude.
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
The user will only need to access the app with a modern web browser through the deployed website.
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
This app consists of HTML5, JS, CSS, JSON, and NodeJS packages REACT, BOOTSTRAP, and AXIOS.

Construction was performed on a Windows system, running services through Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu, and Visual Studio Code.

Services from GitHub.com, Netlify.com, Replit.com, Trello.com were utilized.

API data was sourced from LocationIQ.com.
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
